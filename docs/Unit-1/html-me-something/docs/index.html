    <div class="author">By Chris Russo - April 30, 2020</div>

    <main>
        <h1 class="beg-end"> The Tampa Bay Buccaneers entered the 2020 NFL Draft with a few specific needs, which were
            addressed with
            their first three picks of the draft. This is my short take on each pick:
        </h1>

                <img src="images/tristan-wirfs.png" class="img-2" />
                <h2>Round 1 - Tristan Wirfs - T</h2>
                <p class="para-1">Regardless of QB Tom Brady turning 43 this year, even in his youth he was never known
                    as a mobile
                    quarterback, so it was imperative the Bucs got help on the line. They did so with Wirfs, who brings
                    high athleticism and is able to play both sides of the offensive line.</p>

                <h2>Round 2 - Antoine Winfield, Jr. - S</h2>
                <p class="para-2">After a poor start to the 2019 season, the defensive backfield finished strong. Still,
                    it was
                    regarded as one of the weak links on the team. This was addressed by adding safety Winfield, who
                    is
                    able to play several different formations and will fit nicely in defensive coordinator Todd
                    Bowles'
                    theme.</p>

            <section>
                <img src="images/keyshawn-vaughn.png" class="img-4" />
                <h2>Round 3 - Ke'Shawn Vaughn - RB</h2>
                <p class="para-3">The departure of Peyton Barber leaves Ronald Jones as the feature running back. Help
                    was needed, and
                    obtained, by taking Vaughn in the 3rd. Vaughn is a durable back who is also able to block for QB
                    Brady. He'll be the perfect compliment to Jones' style.</p>

            <section>
                <img src="images/tyler-johnson.png" class="img-5" />
                <h2>Round 5 - Tyler Johnson - WR</h2>
                <p class="para-4">Not having a 4th round pick, the Bucs take wide receiver Johnson in the 5th. He joins
                    pro-bowlers
                    Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, and will likely be #3 on the depth chart. Johnson will replace Breshad
                    Perriman who exits in 2020, playing in the slot and on downs Evans or Godwin is resting.</p>

            <section>
                <img src="images/khalil-davis.png" class="img-6" />
                <h2>Round 6 - Khalil Davis - DT</h2>
                <p class="para-5">With a couple of star defensive lineman aging, it made sense to take Davis in this
                    position. Although
                    he won't start right away, he provides stability for the future and will be able to help keep the
                    starters fresh by playing in rotation.</p>

            <section>
                <img src=" images/chapelle-russell.png" class="img-7" />
                <h2>Round 7 - Chappelle Russell - LB</h2>
                <p class="para-6">Although the Bucs have one of the most solid linebacking starting units in the league,
                    they did have
                    some problems with injuries this past season, leaving the position thin. Russell provides some much
                    needed depth in case of future injury.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <img src=" images/raymond-calais.png" class="img-8" />
                <h2>Round 7 - Raymond Calais - RB</h2>
                <p class="para-7">With their second pick in the 7th round - and final pick of the draft for the Bucs -
                    they select
                    another running back in Calais. He is a smaller back with great speed and quickness, who can play a
                    "slash" type role. He'll be expected to have a greater impact in the passing game. </p>

            Licht had to
            say about the draft, watch:</h3>
